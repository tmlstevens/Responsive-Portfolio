        <h1>Tim Stevens</h1>
        <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <p>My professional experience includes fisheries biology, operations management, information systems, software release management, testing, support, deployment of SaaS platforms, and software product management. In each role I gained experience, perspective, and skills that equipped me for the next. After fifteen years of wearing various information technology hats I realized full-stack web development was the next right step. Two months into my training as a full-stack web developer, it became obvious this was the right move. Although presently junior in my coding skills, I bring a boatload of valuable experience and perspective to the local dev environment.</p>
        <p>Imagine a software engineer who's been a stakeholder at virtually every level of software applications - business analyst, customer liason and representative, launch specialist, user trainer, end user, tester, scrum master, product owner, and project manager. That's me.</p>
