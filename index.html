        <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <h4 style='margin-bottom:1rem'>My Elevator Pitch...</h4>
        <p>My professional experience includes fisheries biology, operations management, information systems, software release management, testing, support, deployment of SaaS platforms, and software product management. In each role I gained experience, perspective, and skills that equipped me for the next. After fifteen years of wearing various information technology hats I realized full-stack web development was the next right step. Two months into my training as a full-stack web developer, it became obvious this was the right move. Although presently junior in my coding skills, I bring a boatload of valuable experience and perspective to the local dev environment.</p>
        <p>Imagine a software engineer who has been virtually every type of software stakeholder - business analyst, customer liaison and representative, launch specialist, user trainer, end user, tester, scrum master, product owner, and project manager. Someone who understands the perspective of every stakeholder. That's me.</p>
        <h4 style='margin:2rem 0 1rem 0'>Strengths and Weaknesses...</h4>
        <p>I'm honest to a flaw as you're about to read. I enjoy learning new technologies and consider myself a slow learner, but my work ethic and diligence are strong and always help me find my legs. I prefer to understand what I'm coding rather than pasting a snippet that I don't. My professional strengths include software requirements, usability enhancements, debugging, process, and building customer rapport. My weaknesses include UI work - the immediate visual return on my markup tends to lead me all over the page. Other weaknesses include: drinking too much company coffee, and rolling my eyes when youngsters assert themselves as software experts after reading a few blogs. I'd rather spend 8 hours working, than 30 minutes talking about it. Give me a toolbox, I'll dump it out, take a quick inventory, and get the job done as best I can.</p>
        <h4 style='margin:2rem 0 1rem 0'>Personal Life...</h4>
        <p>When I'm not learning, working, or coding a side project you can find me with my family, kayak fishing when we get the chance, following our boys' baseball a lot of the time, building furniture when it's not too hot in the garage, hanging out, working out, cooking out, and fixing whatever breaks around the house. I enjoy working with kids of all ages, especially my own. I love my wife (Lynne) of 20+ years, and we're more than proud of our daughter and sons. Samantha is a great writer and artist, very creative, and a free-spirit. Lucas inherited my passion for fishing, while James is showing a solid interest in programming and making crazy videos. I graduated from Texas Tech University in 1999, spent a few years in the panhandle, 7 years in Alabama, a year in Houston, and arrived in the Dallas area in 2010. I plan to be here for a while.</p>
