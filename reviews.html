        <h1>My Professional Reviews</h1>
        <div class='review-container'>
            <p class='review-p'>"Tim was an amazing employee (and a great guy, in general). Tim often would take on any challenge that was put in front of him, and took full ownership and accountability to ensure the project's success. Tim was always professional and pleasant to be around, and gave 120% to anything he did. He demanded everyone to work at his level, with his same integrity towards the project's success. Tim was always super adaptable, able to shift to whatever the need was - whether it was project management, PRODUCT management, or pulling together an offshore testing team and process, I could always count on Tim. I would highly recommend Tim to anyone else, and would gladly work with Tim again in the future."

            <p class='review-p'>"Tim came to work for Kalkomey in 2010. While at Kalkomey, he filled the roles of technical product support, product trainer, code testing manager, and product owner. As the company grew, Tim was able to adjust quickly to its changing needs and learn new skills, playing a vital role in Kalkomey’s success. As I think of the trait I find most valuable in Tim, it's that he truly cares about the company he works for, its reputation and excellence, and its customers. He is able to put that concern into action by being highly organized and attending to details while not losing sight of the big picture. Give him a goal, and then turn him loose — the goal will be met. Last but not least, Tim has a great, dry sense of humor. He contributed to a positive work environment at Kalkomey and got on well with his colleagues and customers."

            <p class='review-p'>"As a founder and CEO of Kalkomey, the trait I found most valuable to have in an employee as I was growing the company is the ability to give him/her a tough task and then turn your back with the assurance the work would get done and done well. Tim Stevens was that kind of employee. I also really appreciated the fact that Tim was never a “yes man.” He wasn’t afraid to tell me bad news, where the company was falling short of expectations, or relay negative comments from a customer. Having an unvarnished view provided, like Tim gave me, was also critical as I was growing the company. Tim was well thought of by our customers, his peers, and those he reported to. Customers appreciated his follow-through, and I heard about this directly from our customers on many occasions. Finally, Tim was always among the top performers per our annual review process. Bottom line: Tim is the kind of employee a CEO wants on the team."

            <p class='review-p'>"Tim Stevens is extremely focused, detail-oriented, and hard working. He is a quick study and will approach any task given to him with enthusiasm and dedication even it it's a duty he has never tackled before. Tim relishes challenges, but he is also a teammate you can count out to carry out the mundane yet necessary tasks to help get the job done as well. On top of that, Tim has a great sense of humor and is the kind of guy you look forward to seeing at the job each day."

            <p class='review-p'>"Tim was my client and the thoroughness with which he started the engagement was absolutely brilliant. The first thing you will notice about Tim is his warmth and attention to detail. He made sure that the global teams were in sync with each other. Hands-on with SQA processes and procedures and used to always give appropriate feedback at the right moment! A great man who can really bring priceless advises and directions to the table. Despite being the go-to person for all things related to the projects, I found Tim to be humble, personable and very easy to interact with. He is an asset to anyone who is looking for top experienced talent! Highly recommended - I am sure wherever he serves, he will exceed expectations and he is an asset to any company that he works for!"

            <p class='review-p'>"Tim is a highly organized, detail-oriented professional with superior project management skills. He is great at outlining project scope, testing, and ultimately seeing projects through to fruition. Tim is also a great communicator both internally with colleagues as well as externally with customers. Last but not least, he is simply a joy to be around and makes any office a better place."

        <div class='review-container'>
            <p class='review-p'>"I worked with Tim for around six years in total. In his position as Release Manager, I always found him to be extremely thorough and organized. Flexible too, since he dealt with multiple reorganizations within the company during that time. He managed the testing team and took great care in their timeliness and the quality of our product releases. On the personal side, he and I got to hang out outside of work too and became good friends. I recommend him wholeheartedly and would welcome the opportunity to work with him again."
